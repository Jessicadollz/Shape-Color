[Hosted Link](https://jessicadollz.github.io/Shape-Color/)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a web page where users can change the color and shape of a displayed element by clicking buttons. The user interface is designed to be consistent and user-friendly, with a clear design and proper alignment of all elements. The project includes a variety of colors and shapes, and uses random generation for both color and shape changes to enhance interactivity and creativity.

## Features
- Change Color Button: Generates a random color from a palette of 10 distinct colors.
- Change Shape Button: Displays a randomly selected shape from a set of predefined shapes.
- Consistent User Interface: Ensures all elements are properly aligned and visually coherent.
- Creative Design Elements: Includes additional design elements and animations to enhance the overall user experience.
